Covid game for our Joy of Computing class!

Currently, the program has 2 folders. The first would be the processing folder that holds the Game_Base_CandD2. Inside that folder, along with the processing file (Game_Base_CandD2), the image files closet.jpg, hallway.png, hostpital_room.jpeg, and stairs.jpg are located inside a folder called data (*the image files HAVE to be stored in this location, with this folder name).
